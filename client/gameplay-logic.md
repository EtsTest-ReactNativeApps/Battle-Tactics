## Reference:
>The Battle Round.

1. Movement Phase
    * _Move any units that are capable of doing so._
2. Psychic Phase
    * Psykers can use powerful mental abilities.
3. Shooting Phase
    * Your units may shoot enemy units.
4. Charge Phase
    * Your units may move into close combat against enemy units.
5. Fight Phase
    * Both players' units pile in and attack with melee weapons.
6. Morale Phase
    * Test the courage of depleted units.

>Once a playerâ€™s turn has ended, their opponent then starts their turn. Once both players have completed a turn, the **battle round** has been completed and the next one begins, and so on, until the battle is concluded.

> ######Additional Note:
> Not all phases are played each turn, it is dependent on several factors. (unit abilities, units killed, etc.)
